Testspackages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows users to publish the tests for packages in the contest.
If the problem is public, in problemset there will be an additional tab where
zipped tests can be downloaded.

How to publish tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure you are the owner of package. It's not possible to publish
tests for package added from external source -- e.g. problemset.
It's because test package is connected to problem, not the probleminstance.

#. Assuming you are the owner of the package, find the problem for which you want to publish the tests.
#. In the contest view, go to "Problems" in "Contest Administration" tab and then click "Advanced settings"
#. next to the chosen problem. Now, in "Tests Packages" form you can specify which test cases you want to publish
#. and specify the publish date. It's also possible to customize file name and description.

After the publish date tests will be visible for ALL participants in the contest.
