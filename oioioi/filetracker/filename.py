    When accessed as a string/unicode, this class acts as if the path
    was not versioned. This is suitable for any normal code, which would
    like to extract let's say the basename or extension of the file.

    Only the code which is Filetracker-aware can extract the versioned name,
    by accessing the :attr:`versioned_name` attribute.
