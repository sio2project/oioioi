"""
This script is used to import schools from the RSPO database,
which is provided by the Ministry of Education and contains all
educational institutions in Poland. Due to the poor quality of this data,
it is likely that SIO administrators will modify school data.
The task of this script is to detect which corrections from newer
and more recent versions of the RSPO database should be accepted and applied,
and which should not.

There are three main data types in this script called:
* db_school: school as an object,
* dict_school: a dictionary in which the keys are the attribute names of the School class,
* rspo_school: a dictionary in which the keys are the column headers from the RSPO database.
