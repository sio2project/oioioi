Here you can export submissions from this contest to the MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity) system
maintained by the Stanford University.
This tool automatically finds all pairs of submissions which look suspiciously similar.
However keep in mind, that MOSS does NOT automatically detect plagiarism; it can only detect
similarity between codes and you will still have to manually make a decision whether the code is copied or not.
You have to be a registered user of the MOSS system in order to provide your user id and make a query.
