Problem Sharing
===============

Allows teachers to share problems.
Currently the only way to share is through a one-sided friendship.

Activating this module adds:

- friendship management view accessible through account menu
- "shared with me" tab in ProblemSet
- choice of access level when creating a new task

All of the features work only for teachers by design.
