"""The status app provides common ground for fetching updates from server.

To get your data returned when asking for ``reverse('get_status')``,
you have to register a function to :data:`oioioi.status.status_registry`.
This function should act similar to programs handlers: take ``request``
and dictionary ``response`` -- output of previous functions,
alter ``response`` and return it.
