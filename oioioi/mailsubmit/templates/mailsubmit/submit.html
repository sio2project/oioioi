    <p>You do not like fiddling with pendrives and CD-ROMs in the mail, do you?
    We don't, too.</p>
    <p>This is why you can use this simplified procedure: upload your solution using
    the form below. You will get back a PDF document, which you send to us in a regular
    postal mail. It will take us a second to scan the code embedded in the document
    and your submissions will be judged.</p>
    <p>You can generate many such documents, but do not send more than one per task.
    If we receive from you multiple documents for a single task, we will pick up one
    randomly.</p>
    <p>If for some reason you would like to use the standard procedure, with CD-ROMs
    or pendrives, you still can.</p>
