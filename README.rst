SIO2 is a free platform for carrying out algorithmic contests and OIOIOI is its
main component --- the web interface.

Installation
------------

It should be easier to begin with a separate folder at first::

  mkdir sio2
  cd sio2

and to install OIOIOI inside a `virtualenv`_::

  virtualenv venv
  . venv/bin/activate

Then OIOIOI and its dependencies can be installed using the following commands::

  git clone git://github.com/sio2project/oioioi.git
  cd oioioi
  pip install -r requirements.txt

OIOIOI is a set of Django Applications, so you need to create a folder with
Django settings and other deployment configuration::

  cd ..
  oioioi-create-config deployment
  cd deployment

The created *deployment* directory looks like a new Django project, but already
configured to serve the OIOIOI portal. You need to at least set the `database
configuration`_ in *settings.py*.

In case of using PostgreSQL, install Psycopg2::

  pip install psycopg2

Finally initialize the database::

  ./manage.py migrate

We use PostgreSQL.

Then you need to copy static files, like images and styles, to the deployment
directory::

  ./manage.py collectstatic

You'll also need lessc (a `LESS`_ compiler, **minimum version 1.3.3**).
First you need to install node.js with npm as described in `their documentation`_,
then install less; either globally as root::

    sudo npm install less

or locally inside virtualenv::

    cd ../venv/
    npm --prefix . --global install less

.. _database configuration: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#databases
.. _LESS: http://lesscss.org/
.. _their documentation: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager

Simple configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the simple configuration, OIOIOI will use the system-installed compilers,
and will not use the safe execution environment. User's programs will be run
with the normal user privileges. **This is not a safe configuration and the
judging will run quite slowly.** It is to easily make OIOIOI up and running for
testing purposes.

Ensure that required dependencies are installed:

* gcc/g++ (Ubuntu package: *build-essential*)
* fpc (Ubuntu package: *fp-compiler*)
* latex with support for Polish (Ubuntu packages: *texlive-latex-base*,
  *texlive-lang-polish*)

and in one terminal run the Django web server::

  ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

and in the other the evaluation daemons::

  ./manage.py supervisor

The *supervisor* process monitors all processes needed by OIOIOI, except the
web server. It has `many nice features`_.

You can create an administrator account by running::

  ./manage.py createsuperuser

If you see a locale error, you may want to circumvent it by providing
another locale to the command::

  LC_ALL=C ./manage.py createsuperuser

Now you're ready to access the site at *http://localhost:8000*.

Production configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Begin with the simple configuration described above.

#. Ensure that production-grade dependencies are installed:

   * lighttpd binary (Ubuntu package: *lighttpd*, shall not be run as service.)
   * uwsgi (*pip install uwsgi*)

#. Make sure you are in the *deployment* folder and the virtualenv is activated.

#. Install `RabbitMQ`_. We tested version 2.8.6 from `RabbitMQ Debian/Ubuntu
   Repos`_. Anything newer should work as well.

#. Uncomment and set *BROKER_URL* in *settings.py* to point to the configured
   RabbitMQ vhost. The default setting corresponds to the default RabbitMQ
   installation.

#. Download sandboxes::

     ./manage.py download_sandboxes

#. Disable system compilers and unsafe code execution by commenting out
   *USE_UNSAFE_EXEC = True* and *USE_LOCAL_COMPILERS = True* in *settings.py*.

#. (optionally) Disable starting the judging process on the server, especially
   if you want to configure judging machines (see below) for judging, what is
   strongly recommended. Comment out the *RUN_LOCAL_WORKERS = True* setting.

#. (optionally) Enable Filetracker server by uncommenting corresponding lines
   in *settings.py* and restart the daemons. This is required for dedicated
   judging machines.

#. Install and configure web server. We recommend using nginx with uwsgi plugin
   (included in *nginx-full* Ubuntu package). An example configuration is
   automatically created as *nginx-site.conf*. Have a look there. What you
   probably want to do is (as root)::

     cp nginx-site.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/oioioi
     ln -s ../sites-available/oioioi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
     service nginx reload

   Once this is done, you no more need to run *manage.py runserver*.

   If you prefer deploying with Apache, an example configuration is created
   as *apache-site.conf*. You would need to install *apache2* and
   *libapache2-mod-uwsgi* packages.

#. Comment out *DEBUG = True* in *settings.py*. This is crucial for security
   and efficiency. Also `set ALLOWED_HOSTS`_.

#. Set admin email in settings. Error reports and teacher account requests will
   be sent there.

#. Set SMTP server in settings. Otherwise new user registration (among others)
   will not work.

#. You probably want to run *manage.py supervisor -d* automatically when the
   system starts. One way is to add the following line to the OIOIOI user's
   crontab (``crontab -e``)::

     @reboot <deployment_folder>/start_supervisor.sh

#. (optionally) If you have efficiency problems or expect heavy load, you may
   consider using gevent as uwsgi event loop. To do so, `install gevent`_ and
   set UWSGI_USE_GEVENT flag in *settings.py*.

#. (optionally) You can also enable content caching. To do so, first you have
   to install dependencies:

   * memcached (Ubuntu package: *memcached*)
   * python-memcached (*pip install python-memcached*)

   Next, you have to uncomment the corresponding lines under "Cache" in
   *settings.py* and set the address of your memcached instance. Note that you
   can run memcached locally or on a remote server. For more information about
   memcached configuration see `official documentation`_.

#. (optionally) You can ensure users are automatically notified of certain
   events in the system - or notify them on your own - just enable
   the Notifications Server.
   For more information, consult the *notifications/README.rst* file.

Setting up judging machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before setting up judging machines, you need to configure the RabbitMQ
server to accept remote connections. This can be done by creating a
new user account or by allowing the default *guest* account to connect
from a remote host, by creating the configuration file
*/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config* with the following content::

  [{rabbit, [{loopback_users, []}]}].

and restarting the RabbitMQ server. Then on every juding machine do the
following:

#. Create a new user account for the judging processes and switch to it.

#. Set up virtualenv::

     virtualenv venv
     . venv/bin/activate

#. Install the *sioworkers* package::

     pip install sioworkers

#. Start the worker process::

     sio-celery-worker amqp://guest:guest@[server]:5672//

   The passed argument must point to the RabbitMQ server configured on the
   server machine.

#. That's all. You probably want to have the worker started automatically when
   system starts. We do not have a ready-made solution for this yet. Sorry!

The worker assumes that the Filetracker server is running on the same server as
RabbitMQ, on the default port 9999. If this is not the case, you should pass
the Filetracker server URL in the *FILETRACKER_URL* environment variable.

Final notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

It is strongly recommended to install the *librabbitmq* Python module (on the
server *and the worker machines*). We observed some not dispatched evaluation
requests when running celery with its default AMQP binding library::

  pip install librabbitmq

Celery will pick up the new library automatically, once you restart the
daemons using::

  ./manage.py supervisor restart all

.. _RabbitMQ: http://www.rabbitmq.com/
.. _RabbitMQ Debian/Ubuntu Repos: http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html

Installing on 64-bit machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sandboxes provided by the SIO2 Project contain 32-bit binaries. Therefore
it is recommended that OIOIOI is installed on a 32-bit Linux system. Otherwise,
required libraries may be missing. Here we list some of them, which we found
needed when installing OIOIOI in a pristine Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS (Precise
Pangolin):

* *libz* (Ubuntu package: *zlib1g:i386*)

Upgrading
---------

Make sure you are in the *deployment* folder and the virtualenv is activated.
Then run::

  pip install -e git://github.com/sio2project/oioioi.git#egg=oioioi
  ./manage.py migrate
  ./manage.py collectstatic
  ./manage.py supervisor restart all

and restart the judging machines.

Upgrading from an old version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're getting the "Upgrading from an old version" message when trying to
sync the database, that means you had an old version of OIOIOI that was based
on version 1.6 or 1.5 of the Django framework. Django 1.7 introduces a new
migration system which requires a more complicated upgrade process.

IMPORTANT: BACKUP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE DOING THE NEXT STEP.

In the typical situation where you didn't create any custom migrations
we've automated the process for you: make sure your database settings
are valid and run::

  ./manage.py upgrade_to_17

That's all. If you have your own custom changes though and they are
incompatible with our script or you want to understand what happens,
the following needs to be done:

#. Install Django 1.6 and South and place all of the old migrations in proper
   directories. The easiest way is to 'git checkout' the last commit
   before the 1.7 commit and do 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. If you have
   custom changes in your OIOIOI directory and they conflict with our changes,
   you'll have to merge them yourself.
   For our automatic script we use a temporary virtualenv and a package
   containing all the necessary files to run the old migrations.

#. Now enable all aplications you have ever used (in the INSTALLED_APPS
   setting) and run ./manage.py migrate. If you don't know which applications
   you've used in the past, just enable them all and run ./manage.py syncdb
   and then ./manage.py migrate. Our script does that.
   If you have your own custom migrations they could be conflicting with
   ours. You'll have to solve these conflicts yourself.

#. Get the newest OIOIOI, install the needed packages and remove all of the old
   migrations. Again, the easiest way is to 'git checkout' the last commit
   and do 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

#. Migrate all the new Django 1.7 migrations. The necessary changes are already
   in the database and in most cases Django will detect this by faking the
   migrations - marking them as applied without actually applying them.
   However some migrations need to be explicitly told to be faked. The commands
   that need to be run in the typical case are::

     ./manage.py migrate --fake balloons  0002
     ./manage.py migrate --fake complaints 0002
     ./manage.py migrate --fake contestexcl 0002
     ./manage.py migrate --fake contestlogo 0002
     ./manage.py migrate --fake contests 0002
     ./manage.py migrate

   assuming that these applications are in INSTALLED_APPS.
   If you've had your own custom migrations before and they introduced
   circular dependency loops on foreign keys in different applications than
   those mentioned above, you also have to run the ./manage.py migrate --fake
   command for them as well.

#. Run ./manage.py collectstatic and start the supervisor, your judging
   machines and the server.

Changes in the deployment directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When new features are added, the configuration files in your custom
*deployment* directory may need an update. An example valid configuration can
always be found in the *oioioi* sources
(*oioioi/deployment* directory, *\*.template* files).
One of the simplest ways to learn about the changes is::

    diff -u path_to_deployment/changed_file path_to_oioioi/oioioi/deployment/changed_file.template

Once you have made sure that your deployment
directory is up-to-date, change *CONFIG_VERSION* in your custom
*deployment/settings.py* so that it equals *INSTALLATION_CONFIG_VERSION* in
*oioioi/default_settings.py*.

List of changes since the *CONFIG_VERSION* numbering was introduced:

#. * Added *unpackmgr* queue entry to *deployment/supervisord.conf*.::

       [program:unpackmgr]
       command={{ PYTHON }} {{ PROJECT_DIR }}/manage.py celeryd -E -l info -Q unpackmgr -c {{ settings.UNPACKMGR_CONCURRENCY }}
       startretries=0
       stopwaitsecs=15
       redirect_stderr=true
       stdout_logfile={{ PROJECT_DIR }}/logs/unpackmgr.log

   * Added *USE_SINOLPACK_MAKEFILES* and *UNPACKMGR_CONCURRENCY*
     options to *deployment/settings.py*.::

       USE_SINOLPACK_MAKEFILES = False
       #UNPACKMGR_CONCURRENCY = 1

#. * Added *Notifications Server* entries to *deployment/supervisord.conf*.::

        [program:notifications-server]
        command={{ PYTHON }} {{ PROJECT_DIR }}/manage.py notifications_server
        redirect_stderr=true
        {% if not settings.NOTIFICATIONS_SERVER_ENABLED %}exclude=true{% endif %}

   * Added *NOTIFICATIONS_* options to *deployment/settings.py*.::

        # Notifications configuration (client)
        # This one is for JavaScript socket.io client.
        # It should contain actual URL available from remote machines.
        NOTIFICATIONS_SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:7887/'

        # Notifications configuration (server)
        NOTIFICATIONS_SERVER_ENABLED = False

        # URL connection string to a Notifications Server instance
        NOTIFICATIONS_OIOIOI_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/'

        # URL connection string for RabbitMQ instance used by Notifications Server
        NOTIFICATIONS_RABBITMQ_URL = 'amqp://localhost'

        # Port that the Notifications Server listens on
        NOTIFICATIONS_SERVER_PORT = 7887

#. * Added *prizesmgr* queue entry to *deployment/supervisord.conf*::

       [program:prizesmgr]
       command={{ PYTHON }} {{ PROJECT_DIR }}/manage.py celeryd -E -l info -Q prizesmgr -c 1
       startretries=0
       stopwaitsecs=15
       redirect_stderr=true
       stdout_logfile={{ PROJECT_DIR }}/logs/prizesmgr.log

#. * Added *ATOMIC_REQUESTS* database option to *deployment/settings.py*::

       DATABASES = {
        'default': {
         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.', # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
         'NAME': '',                      # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
         'USER': '',                      # Not used with sqlite3.
         'PASSWORD': '',                  # Not used with sqlite3.
         'HOST': '',                      # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
         'PORT': '',                      # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.
         'ATOMIC_REQUESTS': True,         # Don't touch unless you know what you're doing.
        }
       }

Well, we don't have a full-fledged User's Guide, but feel free to propose
what should be added here.

Creating task packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a contest, you obviously need some tasks. To add a task to a contest in
OIOIOI, you need to create an archive, called task package. Here are some
pointers, how it should look like:

* `example task packages`_ used by our tests,
* `a rudimentary task package format specification`_.
